# Image_Steganography
 ## Introduction
Welcome to the Steganography Project! This project allows you to hide data within images using steganography techniques and also provides a method to calculate the PSNR values for the images before and after encoding.

## Project Description
Steganography is the art of hiding information within another medium, such as an image, without changing the apparent characteristics of the medium. In this project, we use steganography techniques to embed data into images discreetly. Additionally, we provide functionality to calculate the PSNR values to assess the image quality before and after encoding.

## Usage

### Encoding Data
To encode data into an image.

### Calculating PSNR
To calculate the PSNR value for images before and after encoding
